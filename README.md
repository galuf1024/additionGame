# additionGame
I needed a simple program to help my kids practice math for school. SinceI figured that maybe someone else could use it as well I decided to post it here.
## Upon executing additionGame.py:
1. Asks you how many questions you would like to answer
2. Prompts with addition problems until you complete all the requested problems. 
3. Creates a new file called additiongame-%Y-%m-%d\_%H-%M-%S for each set of problems done. The file includes the problems as well as the answers and an X at the end for any wrong answer then it finishes with the total of right answers and wrong answers. 
4. Asks you if you would like to play again.
